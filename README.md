# Persona Tags Extension

The **Persona Tags Extension** is a feature-rich addition for [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern) that enhances the Persona Management panel with tag filtering and management capabilities. This extension provides a dynamic, collapsible tag filter bar, displays tag labels on persona cards, and offers an intuitive UI for managing persona tags directly within the Persona Description area.

## Features

- **Collapsible Tag Filter Bar:**  
  Easily toggle the visibility of global persona tags with a convenient "Show/Hide Tags" button. When visible, the filter input field appears alongside the toggle for quick filtering.

- **Dynamic Tag Filtering:**  
  Type into the filter input to instantly narrow down the list of available tags.

- **Persona Card Tag Labels:**  
  Each persona card displays its assigned tag labels. Clicking on a tag label toggles the tag filter for quick persona searches.

- **Tag Management UI:**  
  Manage persona-specific tags directly in the Persona Description area. Add new global tags with a customizable color picker and assign them to individual personas.

- **Settings Persistence:**  
  All tag settings and persona-tag assignments are stored in `settings.json` and saved using SillyTavern's debounced settings persistence, ensuring your customizations persist between sessions.
